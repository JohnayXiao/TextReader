The main function of this project is reading. It was finished in May, 2018, which took me almost 2 weeks. To be honesty, it's a hard work, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.

This project had been upload on other website before, this is the first time it is upload on Github.

Happy to share my project with you guys and welcome to contact with me.
